    <p>At the end of every session, the group spends some time going over
    everyone&rsquo;s drives. This is a chance to give credit to a vagabond who
    actually earned an advancement during play but didn&rsquo;t call it out. If
    they fulfilled the condition of their drive during play, they can take their
    advancement then, at session&rsquo;s end.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>At the end of any session, each vagabond may change their choice of one
    drive, their nature, or one connection. Whatever they choose to change, they
    replace with a new version chosen from any of the options across all the
    playbooks.</p>
