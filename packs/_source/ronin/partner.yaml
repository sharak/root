      <p>__________ and I worked together on my first real task of significance
      in the Woodland, deposing a dangerous authority figure of a faction. Who
      did we depose? Why?</p>

      <blockquote>When you fill in this connection, you each mark 2-prestige
      with the faction you helped, and mark 2-notoriety with the faction you
      harmed. During play, if you are spotted together, then any prestige or
      notoriety gains with those factions are doubled for the two of
      you.</blockquote>
