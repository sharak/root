  description: >-
    <p>When you commit yourself to the cause of someone you deem worthy, swear
    an oath to them stating what task you will complete on their behalf. Mark
    exhaustion to reroll a move made in pursuit of that task. You cannot commit
    yourself to another cause until you accomplish the first, or break your
    oath. If you break your oath, fill your exhaustion track and mark
    4-notoriety with the faction whose trust you betrayed. If you fulfill your
    oath, mark 4-prestige with the faction whose trust you kept.</p>
