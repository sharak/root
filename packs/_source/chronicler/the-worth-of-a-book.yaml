  description: >-
    <p>When you study your tomes and scrolls to discover old techniques or
    methods to solve an intractable problem—curing a deadly disease, ending a
    drought, legally unseating a leader, etc—decide what you want to accomplish
    and tell the GM. The GM will give you between 1 to 4 conditions you must
    fulfill to discover a path forward, including time taken, additional
    information needed, mentors or translators needed, facilities/tools needed,
    or the limits of your solution. When you fulfill the conditions, you gain
    whatever knowledge you were seeking—it’s up to you to put to use.</p>
