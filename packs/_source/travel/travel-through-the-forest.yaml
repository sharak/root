    <p>When you travel from clearing to clearing through the forest, the band
    collectively decides how it travels and one member rolls:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Slowly, foraging heavily: everyone clears 2-depletion; the band
    collectively marks an exhaustion for each band member; <strong>-1 to the
    roll</strong>.</li>

    <li>Carefully, avoiding trouble: the band collectively marks one depletion
    or exhaustion for each band member; <strong>+1 to the roll</strong>.</li>

    <li>As quickly as possible: everyone marks exhaustion and depletion;
    <strong>+2 to the roll</strong>.</li>

    </ul>

        <p>On a 10+, you pass through the forest to any clearing on the other
        side. Along the way, one of you spots an interesting site; you leave
        markers so you can return after you finish your trip. And the transit is
        largely safe.</p>

      value: >-
        <p>On a 7-9, you pass through the forest to any clearing on the other
        side. Along the way, one of you spots an interesting site; you leave
        markers so you can return after you finish your trip. But something from
        the forest is following you; you can let it track you, or every vagabond
        marks exhaustion to lose it.</p>
    failure:

      value: >-
        <p>On a 6-, you run afoul of one of the forest&rsquo;s dangers during
        the trip, and you can&rsquo;t escape it easily; deal with it before you
        can reach the clearing on the other side.</p>
