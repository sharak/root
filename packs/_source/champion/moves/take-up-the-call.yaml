  description: >-
    <p>Name two non-denizen factions: declare one to be the best hope for the
    Woodland (The Just) and the other evil tyrants (The Enemy).</p>

    <p>The Just:______________ The Enemy:______________</p>

    <p>Take +1 ongoing to protect members of the Just or harm agents of the
    Enemy. You may switch which factions you consider to be the Just or the
    Enemy at the end of any session by clearing all prestige from the faction
    which no longer inspires you; your reputation with both factions remains the
    same.</p>

    <p>Choose a role you often fill as a champion:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Luminary: When you persuade an NPC to fight for the Just or resist the
    charms of the Enemy, roll with Might instead of Charm.</li>

    <li>Paladin: When you inflict harm on the Enemy, inflict 1 additional harm;
    when you suffer harm protecting the Just, suffer 1 fewer harm.</li>

    <li>Emissary: When you mark prestige with the Just, mark an additional
    prestige. When you mark notoriety with the Enemy, mark an additional
    notoriety.</li>

    </ul>
