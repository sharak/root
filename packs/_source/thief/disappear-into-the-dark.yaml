  description: >-
    <p>When you slip into shadows while unnoticed, mark exhaustion and hold 1.
    As long as you remain quiet, move slowly, and hold 1 for this move, you will
    remain hidden. If you inadvertently reveal yourself, lose your hold. Spend
    your hold to reveal yourself from a darkened place, suddenly and without
    warning. If you attack someone immediately after spending the hold, take +3
    on the roll.</p>
