      <blockquote>If you share information with them after reading a tense
      situation, you both benefit from the +1 for acting on the answers. If you
      help them while they attempt a roguish feat, you gain choices on the help
      move as if you had marked 2-exhaustion when you mark
      1-exhaustion.</blockquote>
