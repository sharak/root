    <p>When you travel along the paths to another clearing, you can always give
    +1 to the roll or clear 2-exhaustion, your choice. When you travel through
    the forest to another clearing, you can always give +1 to the roll or clear
    2-depletion, your choice. In both cases, before you arrive at the next
    clearing, you can ask the GM any two questions about the next clearing,
    based on what you remember from your last time through.</p>
