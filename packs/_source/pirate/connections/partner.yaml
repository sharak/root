      <p>____________ and I seized valuable cargo from a faction together. Who
      did we rob? Why?</p>

      <blockquote>When you fill in this connection, you each mark 2-prestige
      with the faction you helped, and mark 2-notoriety with the faction you
      harmed. During play, if you are spotted together, then any prestige or
      notoriety gains with those factions are doubled for the two of
      you.</blockquote>
