  description: >-
    <p>By default, your ship has a wear track with four boxes. Mark wear when it
    suffers serious damage or when a move calls for it. When your shipâ€™s wear
    track is filled, it is dead in the water and must be repaired at port. If
    you must mark wear on your ship but its whole track is full, your ship is
    lost. If you ever lose the ship the GM may present you with an opportunity
    to get a new one.</p>

    <p><strong>Drag-and-drop</strong> your ship:
