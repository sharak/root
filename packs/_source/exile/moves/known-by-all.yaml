        <p>On a 7-9, their loyalty has not diminished; they offer whatever aid
        they can, even risking their own reputation and safety. However, they
        can only assist you if they can pretend you forced their hand and cover
        their tracks when you leave; mark as much notoriety with their faction
        as you added to your roll.</p>
