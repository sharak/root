  description: >-
    <p>You have a mask or outfit you wear when you go about your most
    destructive work—more of a calling card, an identifier of “the real you,”
    than a disguise. Treat it as a piece of equipment with two boxes of wear.
    While you have your mask on, any notoriety you gain is doubled, any prestige
    you gain is halved, and take +1 to trust fate and all Scoundrel playbook
    moves. If your mask is ever taken from you, mark exhaustion. If your mask is
    ever destroyed, mark 4-exhaustion. If your mask is destroyed, you can make a
    new mask when time passes.</p>
