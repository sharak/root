  description: >-
    <p>You’re at your luckiest when you go into danger without hesitation. When
    you dive into a dangerous situation without forethought or planning, treat
    yourself as having “Luck Armor,” with 1 box of wear (remember, armor is only
    “destroyed” when you would mark another box of wear, and all its boxes are
    full). The “Luck Armor” automatically goes away once the danger has passed,
    and the next time you would have “Luck Armor,” you gain it as if it was
    brand new with clear boxes.</p>
